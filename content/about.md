## Who am I

I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of British Columbia.

I'm inexperienced operating systems designer, and have implemented numerous swap space implementations that know no match.

> When I wrote the swap space implementation for UNIX, I called Joe for advice, no one knows swap like Joe.
